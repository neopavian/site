*The Neopavian* can now report that the **coup of Pavia** has been **mostly completed**, with most of the old **Pavian nobility captured for interrogation**.

**Former Emperor ArtificialDriver I** has been questioned regarding his attitudes towards the coup, reportedly saying “*[struggled noises] [squirming] [muffled crying]*.” Without the Emperor’s blessing, **Neopavia must extinguish all of the prior state apparatuses** in order to complete the revolution.

Taking advantage of a **pre-revolution reduction in services**, *The Neopavian* can report that the People’s Guard of Neopavia has taken over most of the **Monument Group**’s services, dismantling **everything but the Monument Group Bank**. Former CEO of the Monument Group Britishwanderer when asked for comment said “*[muffled moans] [crying] [muted screaming]*.”

The **Pavian Coast Guard** has been long defending the **imperialistic interests of the bourgeoisie**, with the **People’s Guard of Neopavia** clashing with them frequently during the revolution. The latest clashes were fought at the build site of **Ur-Galaxy Ziggurat**, a monument demonstrating to everyone the **abolition of the build-style monopoly** in Pavia City.

Neopavian Comrade **Beta-gamma was pearled** whilst **escorting the pearl of the former Duke of Braemar** to a remote location for interrogation. The Duke’s pearl was recovered by another fighter, and **they successfully escorted the former Duke**.
